Pairing table for mds-gpp


## Using

To use this app, you need to get all avatar images and put them in the <b>assets folder</b> using only numbers to name them.
Example:
```
1.png
2.png
3.png
4.png
5.png
X.png
```
<b>Keep the X.png on the folder.</b>

And then, you need to modify the <b>line 1 at Index.js:</b>

```Javascript
let numbersOfMembers = A;
```
where A is the number of avatar assets that you've put on the assets folder.
